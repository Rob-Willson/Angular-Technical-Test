# Angular-Technical-Test
 A single page web application made using the Angular framework, which gets data from an API, manipulates that data, and then displays it as a chart using d3.js.
 
 To use (requires Angular CLI):
   1. Download
   2. Run npm install command
   3. Run ng serve command

NOTE: By default this pulls from the cryptocompare.com public API.
To use the private API, paste your Cryptocompare API key into the 'apiKey' variable in \app\core\http.service.ts
